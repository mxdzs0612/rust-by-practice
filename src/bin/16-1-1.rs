// println! and format!
// Printing is handled by a series of [macros][macros] defined in [std::fmt][fmt] Some of which include:

// format!: write formatted text to [String][string]
// print!: same as format! but the text is printed to the console (io::stdout).
// println!: same as print! but a newline is appended.
// eprint!: same as format! but the text is printed to the standard error (io::stderr).
// eprintln!: same as eprint!but a newline is appended.
// All parse text in the same fashion. As a plus, Rust checks format correctness at compile time.

// format!
